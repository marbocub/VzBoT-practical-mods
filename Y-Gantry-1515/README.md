# VzBoT-practical-mods/Y-Gantry-1515

This is Y gantry (XY carriage) bottom parts for the VzBoT Vz330 used to replace X gantry from 2020 size to lighter weighted 1515 size.

The geometry and shape is based on the Vz330 V1.2's Y gantry except for minor differences and is fully compatible.

note: After the Vz330 V1.2 is released, the left and the right of the Y gantry are not common parts.  If you are using less than V1.2, please re-printing and combining Y-gantry-top-left and Y-gantry-top-right released by official VzBoT.
